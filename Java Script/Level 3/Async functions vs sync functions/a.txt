Async Functions vs Sync Functions

What does Synchronous mean?
- It means tasks happen one after another, in order. Only one task is being done at a time, sequentially.

What does Asynchronous mean?
- It is the opposite of synchronous. Tasks happen in parts and can run simultaneously. JavaScript switches between tasks quickly.

Let's build some intuition:

Human brain and body are single-threaded:
1. We can only focus on one thing at a time.
2. But, we can switch our focus between tasks or delegate tasks to others.

Similarly, JavaScript is single-threaded:
1. It can switch between tasks.
2. It can also assign tasks to other functions (like using `setTimeout` or asynchronous operations).
